## Technical Architecture

### Key Components
- **Chat Context**: Manages conversation state and tool execution
- **Project System**: Handles project data and settings
- **Tool Registry**: Manages tool registration and execution
- **Data Store**: Persistent storage for projects and data
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery system
- **UI State Management**: Signal-based reactive state management
- **Interrupt System**: Manages interruption of tools and text generation

### UI Layout System
The application features a responsive layout system with three main states:
- **Normal**: Default state with left panel at 30% width
- **Left-expanded**: Left panel expanded to full width, right panel collapsed
- **Right-expanded**: Right panel expanded to full width, left panel collapsed

Toggle buttons in each panel allow users to switch between these states.

The application also includes intelligent tab management:
- **HTML Content Auto-switching**: When HTML content is generated in a response, the application automatically switches to the Preview tab and sets the layout to normal mode for optimal viewing
- **Re-execute Button**: HTML content includes a re-execute button that refreshes the HTML and switches to the Preview tab

### Security Considerations
- Keep API keys secure and never commit them to version control
- LDAP connections should use appropriate authentication
- Code execution is sandboxed but should be used cautiously
- Review tool permissions before deployment
- Validate all inputs in server-side tools

### Interrupt System
The application features a comprehensive interrupt system that allows users to:
- Interrupt specific running tools by their ID
- Interrupt all running tools at once
- Interrupt text generation
- Get immediate feedback on interrupt status

The interrupt system is implemented with:
- AbortController for clean cancellation
- Proper resource cleanup
- UI state synchronization
- Consistent user feedback messages

The interrupt button intelligently handles different scenarios:
1. If a specific tool is running: Interrupts that tool
2. If multiple tools are running: Interrupts all tools
3. If text is being generated: Interrupts the generation
4. Provides clear feedback through toast messages

## Project Management

Tool-Bot includes a robust project management system that allows you to:

- Create multiple projects with different configurations
- Switch between projects easily
- Configure project-specific AI models and system prompts
- Enable or disable specific tools for each project
- Clone existing projects to use as templates or backups
- Manage project metadata and settings

To configure tools for a project:
1. Click "Manage Projects" in the project dropdown
2. Find the project you want to configure
3. In the Project Configuration section, check or uncheck tools in the "Enabled Tools" list
4. Click "Save Configuration" to apply your changes

This allows you to create specialized projects with only the tools needed for specific tasks.

To clone a project:
1. Click "Manage Projects" in the project dropdown
2. Find the project you want to clone
3. Click the "Clone" button
4. Enter a name for the new project (or accept the default "Copy of [Original]")
5. The cloned project will appear in your project list with all the same settings

## Best Practices for Component Development

When developing components for Tool-Bot, follow these best practices:

1. **Event Handler Management**:
   - Store event handler functions as class properties
   - Use these stored references when both adding and removing event listeners
   - This ensures proper cleanup and prevents memory leaks

2. **State Management**:
   - Use signals for reactive state
   - Prefer computed signals for derived state
   - Set up effects to respond to state changes

3. **Component Lifecycle**:
   - Initialize all resources in a consistent way
   - Clean up all resources in the destroy method
   - Store cleanup functions in an array for easy management

4. **UI Layout Interactions**:
   - Respect the established layout system (normal, left-expanded, right-expanded)
   - Avoid duplicate event handlers for layout controls
   - Use the signals from AppStore for layout state

## Testing Best Practices

When writing tests for Tool-Bot, follow these guidelines:

1. **Mock External Dependencies**:
   - Use Vitest's mocking capabilities to isolate the component being tested
   - Mock complex handlers like LLMHandler, ToolHandler, and MessageManager
   - For streaming responses, mock at the method level rather than trying to recreate the full stream

2. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Include tests for escaped characters in JSON responses
   - Test handling of split chunks (e.g., path strings split across multiple chunks)
   - Verify error recovery mechanisms work correctly

3. **Test Structure**:
   - Use clear describe/it blocks to organize tests
   - Set up mocks in beforeEach blocks
   - Clear mocks in afterEach blocks
   - Use meaningful test names that describe the behavior being tested

4. **Test Config**:
   - Exclude temporary directories (e.g., .local) using vitest.config.ts
   - Configure appropriate timeouts for async tests

Example of mocking a streaming response:
```typescript
// Instead of trying to mock the entire stream reader protocol:
(llmHandler as any).callLLMStream = vi.fn().mockImplementation(async (messages, callbacks) => {
  // Call the onStart callback
  callbacks.onStart?.();

  // Simulate processing chunks with problematic patterns
  const testChunks = [
    { contentBlockDelta: { contentBlockIndex: 1, delta: { toolUse: { input: "first-part" } } } },
    { contentBlockDelta: { contentBlockIndex: 1, delta: { toolUse: { input: "second-part" } } } }
  ];

  // Process each chunk
  for (const chunk of testChunks) {
    callbacks.onChunk?.(chunk);
  }

  // Call the completion callback with the final message
  callbacks.onComplete?.({
    role: "assistant",
    content: [{ toolUse: { input: "first-partsecond-part" } }]
  });

  return finalMessage;
});
```

# Bugs

## Fixed Issues ‚úÖ

### JSON Parsing Issues with Streaming Tool Calls

We identified and fixed issues with the JSON parsing of streaming tool calls in scenarios involving:

1. **Escaped Quotes**: When tool calls contained escaped backslashes (e.g., "\\\\"), the JSON parser would sometimes fail, causing the streaming to hang.

2. **Split Path Strings**: When path strings were split across multiple chunks (e.g., "mnt/audit-re" + "view-ag"), they weren't being properly concatenated.

3. **Unbalanced JSON**: Some stream chunks had unbalanced JSON braces that caused parsing errors.

4. **Incremental Tool Use Inputs**: When tool use inputs are streamed as multiple small chunks (e.g., `"{\"`, `"path\": \"/mn"`, `"t/audit"`), they now properly accumulate into a complete tool use input.

5. **Malformed Tool Use JSON**: When the final accumulated JSON for a tool use is invalid (e.g., missing closing quotes or braces), we now attempt to fix it before execution.

6. **Unterminated JSON Strings**: When tool execution stops with JSON content containing unterminated strings (especially in file operations), we can now reconstruct valid JSON from the partial data.

The fixes include:

- Implemented oboe.js for robust streaming JSON parsing
- Simplified handling of streaming JSON with proper line-by-line processing
- Enhanced error recovery for JSON parsing issues
- Added state tracking to follow tool use context across multiple chunks
- Implemented proper message state management for better chunk processing
- Added JSON validation and automatic repair for tool use inputs
- Created a streamlined JSON fixer for common issues like unclosed quotes and missing braces
- Added heuristic-based JSON reconstruction for common file operation patterns
- Added comprehensive tests for all these scenarios

Examples of problematic patterns that are now handled correctly:

## Recent Improvements üöÄ

### Streaming JSON Parsing Refactoring

We've significantly improved the tool's handling of streaming JSON responses by:

1. **Adopting oboe.js**: Integrated a dedicated streaming JSON parsing library that's specifically designed to handle partial and incomplete JSON data.

2. **Simplifying the Implementation**: Replaced our complex custom parsing logic with a more streamlined approach that:
   - Processes JSON data line-by-line
   - Intelligently accumulates tool use input chunks
   - Tracks state more effectively across streaming chunks

3. **Maintaining Robustness**: Our new implementation still handles all the edge cases from before:
   - Escaped quotes and backslashes
   - Split path strings across chunks
   - Incremental tool use inputs
   - Unterminated JSON strings

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Updated our test suite to verify all parsing scenarios work correctly with the new implementation.

The result is a more maintainable codebase with fewer custom workarounds and better resilience to the various types of JSON parsing issues that can occur in streaming contexts.
