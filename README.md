## Development Environment

### Build & Run Scripts

| Script          | Description                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`dev`**      | Starts both client (Vite) and server (Nodemon) in dev mode   |
| **`build`**    | Builds client and compiles server to `dist-server/`          |
| **`start:dev`**| Runs compiled server in development mode                      |
| **`start:prod`**| Runs server in production mode with .env                     |
| **`clean`**    | Deletes dist folders                                         |
| **`preview`**  | Serves production build at http://localhost:4173             |

### Docker Setup

1. **Build**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t tool-bot .
    ```

2. **Development mode**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 \
      -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app \
      -v /usr/src/app/node_modules \
      --env-file .env \
      tool-bot
    ```

3. **Production mode**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env tool-bot
    ```

## Technical Architecture

### Key Components
- **Chat Context**: Manages conversation state and tool execution
- **Project System**: Handles project data and settings
- **Tool Registry**: Manages tool registration and execution
- **Data Store**: Persistent storage for projects and data
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery system
- **UI State Management**: Signal-based reactive state management

### UI Layout System
The application features a responsive layout system with three main states:
- **Normal**: Default state with left panel at 30% width
- **Left-expanded**: Left panel expanded to full width, right panel collapsed
- **Right-expanded**: Right panel expanded to full width, left panel collapsed

Toggle buttons in each panel allow users to switch between these states.

### Security Considerations
- Keep API keys secure and never commit them to version control
- LDAP connections should use appropriate authentication
- Code execution is sandboxed but should be used cautiously
- Review tool permissions before deployment
- Validate all inputs in server-side tools

## Project Management

Tool-Bot includes a robust project management system that allows you to:

- Create multiple projects with different configurations
- Switch between projects easily
- Configure project-specific AI models and system prompts
- Enable or disable specific tools for each project
- Clone existing projects to use as templates or backups
- Manage project metadata and settings

To configure tools for a project:
1. Click "Manage Projects" in the project dropdown
2. Find the project you want to configure
3. In the Project Configuration section, check or uncheck tools in the "Enabled Tools" list
4. Click "Save Configuration" to apply your changes

This allows you to create specialized projects with only the tools needed for specific tasks.

To clone a project:
1. Click "Manage Projects" in the project dropdown
2. Find the project you want to clone
3. Click the "Clone" button
4. Enter a name for the new project (or accept the default "Copy of [Original]")
5. The cloned project will appear in your project list with all the same settings

## Best Practices for Component Development

When developing components for Tool-Bot, follow these best practices:

1. **Event Handler Management**:
   - Store event handler functions as class properties
   - Use these stored references when both adding and removing event listeners
   - This ensures proper cleanup and prevents memory leaks

2. **State Management**:
   - Use signals for reactive state
   - Prefer computed signals for derived state
   - Set up effects to respond to state changes

3. **Component Lifecycle**:
   - Initialize all resources in a consistent way
   - Clean up all resources in the destroy method
   - Store cleanup functions in an array for easy management

4. **UI Layout Interactions**:
   - Respect the established layout system (normal, left-expanded, right-expanded)
   - Avoid duplicate event handlers for layout controls
   - Use the signals from AppStore for layout state
