## Development Environment

### Build & Run Scripts

| Script          | Description                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`dev`**      | Starts both client (Vite) and server (Nodemon) in dev mode   |
| **`build`**    | Builds client and compiles server to `dist-server/`          |
| **`start:dev`**| Runs compiled server in development mode                      |
| **`start:prod`**| Runs server in production mode with .env                     |
| **`clean`**    | Deletes dist folders                                         |
| **`preview`**  | Serves production build at http://localhost:4173             |

### Docker Setup

1. **Build**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t tool-bot .
    ```

2. **Development mode**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 \
      -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app \
      -v /usr/src/app/node_modules \
      --env-file .env \
      tool-bot
    ```

3. **Production mode**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env tool-bot
    ```

## Technical Architecture

### Key Components
- **Chat Context**: Manages conversation state and tool execution
- **Project System**: Handles project data and settings
- **Tool Registry**: Manages tool registration and execution
- **Data Store**: Persistent storage for projects and data
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery system

### Security Considerations
- Keep API keys secure and never commit them to version control
- LDAP connections should use appropriate authentication
- Code execution is sandboxed but should be used cautiously
- Review tool permissions before deployment
- Validate all inputs in server-side tools

The main one is: ### Known Issues üêû
1. Chat scroll behavior needs improvement.
we used to have a scroll to bottom button. Also the auto scroll to bootomo should only work if the scroll possition is at the botom of the page if it is up a little the autoscroll should stop and the user should control the scrolling. Also if there are no messages we should say something like: "How can I help you today?" Also the ai avatar should be a nice svg of "The AI named Kit (derived from toolkit) a helphul assistant.
