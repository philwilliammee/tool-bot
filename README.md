# AI Chat Assistant

REQUIRED: Node 20.6.0 or higher

An AI-powered chat bot that can help with various tasks through natural language conversation. Engage in meaningful dialogue, get help with questions, and explore different topics through an intuitive chat interface.

> **Note**: This is a development tool and proof-of-concept. Not intended for production use.

## Features

- AI-powered conversational interface
- Real-time chat interactions
- Context-aware responses
- Automatic error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Support for various types of queries and tasks
- Comprehensive tool integration system
- Directory services integration
- Advanced visualization capabilities
- File system operations
- Mathematical computations

## Quick Start

1. Clone and setup environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/ai-chat-assistant
cd ai-chat-assistant
cp example.env .env
```

2. Configure your credentials in `.env`:

```bash
# For AWS Bedrock
AWS_REGION=your-aws-region
VITE_BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=your-model-id
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-access-key
AWS_SECRET_KEY=your-aws-secret-key

# For OpenAI
AI_CLIENT=openai
OPENAI_API_SESSION_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com
```

3. Install and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

## API Integration

This project supports multiple AI providers, including AWS Bedrock and OpenAI.

### Supported

- AWS Bedrock API
- OpenAI API

### Potential Future Integrations

- Ollama (local inference)
- Google Vertex AI
- Anthropic Claude API
- Other Open Source Models

**Contributing Integrations:** Pull requests for additional AI provider integrations are welcome! The project's architecture is designed to be extensible. Ollama integration would be particularly valuable as it would allow users to run models locally without cloud API costs.

#### To add a new integration

1. Implement the core API service interface.
2. Add appropriate environment configuration.
3. Provide documentation for API setup.
4. Include example prompts optimized for the new model.

Check the `server/bedrock/bedrock.service.ts` and `server/openai/openai.service.ts` files for examples of how API integration is currently implemented.

## Technical Architecture

- Built with TypeScript and Vite
- AWS Bedrock and OpenAI integration for AI capabilities
- Component-based architecture
- Signal-based state management
- Clean and responsive UI
- Integrated tool system with type safety

### Key Components

- **Chat Context (converseStore)**: Holds the entire conversation. Automatically handles AI service calls whenever a new `user` message is added, and executes tools if an `assistant` message includes a `toolUse` block.
- **Chat Interface (Chat.ts)**: Primarily a UI layer. Listens to user input, adds new messages to the context, and renders updates whenever the context changes.
- **Work Area**: Provides an admin interface to view/edit messages and manage the conversation history.
- **Tool System**: Comprehensive tool integration with support for various operations including file system access, mathematical computations, and web services.
- **Error Handling**: A robust approach that attempts to retry errors; not production-ready.

fetch_url({
  url: 'https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=42.3601&longitude=-71.0589',
});
```

### Directory Services Example

```javascript
html({
  html: `
    <canvas id="myChart" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
    <script>
      var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
      var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {

## Example Prompts

search for something and display something interesting about it in html.

Make me an amazing chart! I will show it to my fiends, and display your skills and craftsmanship at fine web design.

Wait what happened, earlier you were making amazing charts. I told them how great they are. You can do better that that, really try to impress them.

This is stunning but I know you can do more. Elevate it and take it to the next level.

(@todo)
- auto token generation
- csv upload
- refactor converse utils
- add local database
- add save project
